<p>Well,this is pretty late, but I will do it any way.
</p>
<p>Last year my only resolution was 'to learn Qt' and I did it! Although I didn't 'master' Qt, but at least I am now able to write programs with GUI and I am happy with it. I also learnt something outside the plan-client side web development, and I think it seemed more fun.
</p>
<p>So this is the plan for this year-a much detailed one :P Hope I can accomplish it.

<ul><li>
AI AI AI! I am definitely going to venture into the realm of artificial intelligence! Starting with games and heuristics, I will try to learn things like machine learning and language processing. I have already started coding a gomoku (but it has been paused for a long time :P). And <i>hopefully</i> I could also take an AI course in university this year.
</li>
<li>
My blog. Er maybe this isn't really a blog. But whatever, I am going to move to a new platform again. Blogspot is good cuz I could code some custom themes. But the old template system provides too few special tags and the new one is just not for people who like to work directly with codes. Maybe I will try jekyll. Or maybe I will use django(yeah I am also gonna learn about it.) And I am going to change the theme as well. I like the bookish look but it's a bit er, too colorful. The layout is also quite rigid. Currently I have a rough idea of a 'Chinese-y' theme. But we shall see.
</li>
<li>
Emacs. Why not Vi? I don't know. It's just a random choice. But since everyone talks about the coolness of such tools, I think I gotta try it out.
</li>
<li>
Web development. There are still a lot of things to be learnt, canvas, svg, and the new CSS3 stuff that keep coming out will be my primary pursuit. Also my skills of coding server-side services are terrible and maybe I should try learning django or node.js.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Hmm that's pretty much of it. Let's see how much I could do in this year.
</p>
<p>Happy (belated) New Year!
