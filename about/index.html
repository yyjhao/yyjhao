<h3>
About
</h3>
<p>
I am an Ubuntu user turned Mac user, currently studying Computer Science
in National University of Singapore.
</p>
<p>
I love JavaScript, and I have been in the world of HTML5 and CSS3
for quite a while. I also enjoy making my apps compatible with Mobile Safari, because
it's really interesting to see your page displaying better on these mobile devices than
on IE :P
</p>
<p>
	I am also a C++ user, mostly using it with Qt to make cross-platform applications 
	and for algorithmic challenges.
</p>
<p>
	And yeah, I like Spongebob.
