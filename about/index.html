<h3>
About
</h3>
<p>
I am a second-year CS student currently studying
in National University of Singapore.
</p>
<p>
I enjoying the process of problem solving - both solving puzzles and real-life problem,
therefore I like competitive programming (still far from the top though) and building
apps.
</p>
<p>
I like AI-related things, but I am still in the process of getting into it.
</p>
<p>
I love JavaScript, and I have been in the world of HTML5 and CSS3
for quite a while. It's just so <del>messy</del> convenient.
</p>
<p>
I am also a C++ coder, mostly using it with Qt to make cross-platform applications 
and for algorithmic challenges. I am also intrigued by the possibility of optmizing
some part of JavaScript code with asm.js through C++.
</p>
<p>
Of course, I like trying out other languages. Haskell for one is rather
interesting.
</p>
<p>
And yeah, I like Spongebob.
