<h3>
About
</h3>
<p>
I was born in China. At the age of 16, I went to study in Singapore with
a scholarship offered by MOE in Singapre. Currently I have finished
my 'A' Levels and am waiting for my university offers. 
</p>
<p>
I mostly code in C++ and JavaScript. I have also learnt a lot
of CSS3 and HTML5 features, and am constantly improving my skills in Web 
Development. To write apps with GUI, I use Qt because it supports all major
platforms (I am a Ubuntu user by the way). I also know some Python, Bash and PHP.
