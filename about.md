### About

I am a second-year CS student currently studying in National University of
Singapore.

I enjoying the process of problem solving - both solving puzzles and real-life
problem, therefore I like building apps. I used to take part in competitive
programming trainings, but alas there's little time to really go into it now.

My academic interest is mostly AI. I have built games ([gomoku](/2012/06/gomoku-
in-html5.html) and [hearts](/2013/12/hearts-with-pomdp.html)) and done some
undergrad research work on distributed Gaussian Process, and I am looking
forward to learn more about AI in the future.

Other than that, I like making HTML5 web apps and play around with CSS3 magics
when I am free.

And yeah, I like Spongebob.
