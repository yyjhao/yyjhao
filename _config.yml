  Dots:

    description: >
      Dots move. Dots are attracted to your mouse. Dots bounce off when 
      colliding with the borders. Dots slow down over time. These are 
      the simple physics rules applied to the dots in this game. You can 
      also enable the paint mode in the settings on the upper left corner, 
      and see some crazy crayon-ish painting!
  Solitaire Three in One:
    description: >
      My three Solitaire games (Klondike, Freecell and Spider) coded in HTML 
      and javascript. It runs slow on browsers other than Chrome as it uses 
      a lot of css3 animation. Sold to a company in December 2011.

    description: >
      My first 'published' Qt app. It's written for our school's decade-old 
      electronic message board web site. Reception was poor though, as people 
      prefer to just click the bookmark link in their browser.

    description: >
      A Qt app I coded to try out the graphical library I wrote for Treb

      wireless network in my boarding school.
