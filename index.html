		<p>
			Hi there! I am Yujian, a student waiting to attend University.
			I can code in C++ and write Qt apps. I have also learnt HTML5,
			CSS3 and JavaScript on my own. I like learning new techniques and
			languages and enjoy making things with the knowledge I gather.

		<h3>About This Site</h3>
	</header>
	<div class='widget-content'>
		<p>
			I built this site with Jekyll. Although I deem it my personal site,
			it is more of a platform for me to publish my projects.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Occasionally</i> I also post some tutorials ({{ site.categories.Tutorials | size }}
			so far) and a bit of rambling. But as you can see, I don't update it very often. 
		</p>
		<p>
			That said, I have started it only in 2011, so perhaps I 
			may change my habit of blogging in the future?
